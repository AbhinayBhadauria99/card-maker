### NOTE:  In case of problem while pushing in github . Do remove all `.git` files by `rm -rf .git` and then initialise git in parent most folder. We have to push all changes to `user` and `server` seperately, for both frontend and backend after commits. 

## Installation Guide for User directory.
1. `npx create-react-app .` 
2. `npm start`
